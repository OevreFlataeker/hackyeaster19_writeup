When we superimpose all three dots images we get an image where 2 squares
are not yet occupied by black dots. These are the dots missing in the lower right square.
They are at 12 o clock and 3 o clock.
When we now superimpose the dot template over the letters we can read from left to right, top to bottom: "HELLOBUCK"

Now lets rotate the dot template 90 degrees to the left an we get
THEPASSWO

again to the left
RDISWHITE

again to the left
CHOCOLATE

-->THEPASSWORDISWHITECHOCOLATE.

We enter "WHITECHOCOLATE" to get the flag "he19-n3B2-lZTU-LQTJ-nlRC"
