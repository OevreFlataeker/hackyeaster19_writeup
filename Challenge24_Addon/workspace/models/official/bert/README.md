and testing.

The academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a
number of tasks can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805.

This repository contains TensorFlow 2.0 implementation for BERT.

Since the repository is under active development at this moment, the source of
truth is TensorFlow team's internal repository. The repo is not officially
released as it is not stable and requires extensive testing.
